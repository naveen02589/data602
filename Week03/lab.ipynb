    "Apart from classifcation and regression, there are other types of supervised learning too\n",
    "1) Naive Bayes\n",
    "A Naive Bayes algorithm is used for large datasets. The approach works on the fundamental that every programme in the algorithm works independently. This means that the presence of one feature will not impact the other. Generally, it is used in text classification, recommendation systems, and others.\n",
    "A decision tree consists of control statements containing decisions and their consequences. The output in a decision tree relates to the labelling of unforeseen data. ID3 and CART are some of the popular decision tree algorithms widely used across various industries.here are different types of Naive Bayes models, and the decision tree remains the most popular among business organizations. A decision tree is a unique supervised learning algorithm structurally resembling a flowchart\n",
    "2) Neutral networks\n",
    "This type of supervised learning algorithm is used to group or categorize raw data. In addition, it is used for finding a pattern or interpreting sensory data. However, the algorithm requires numerous amounts of computation resources. As a result, its uses are constrained.\n",
    "3) Random forest\n",
    "A random forest algorithm is often called an ensemble method because it combines different supervised learning methods to conclude. Moreover, it uses many decision trees to output the classification of individual trees. As a result, it is widely used across industries."
